h1. Welcome to Friends of We

FOW is a rails based app. 

Key gems/plugins:

* authlogic
* inherited_resources
* formtastic

h2. Useful Custom Rake Tasks for Development

These will need to be improved later and may be a little redundent right now.

* rake db:build - creates DB, runs migrations, sets up railmail and loads seed data
* rake db:rebuild - destroys DB, then runs build
* rake db:populate - loads fake data
* rake db:repopulate - runs rebuild then populates with fake data

h2. Getting Development Setup

To prevent secret information from appearing in the public repo.  You will need create these files from the examples.

* config/database.yml
* config/initializers/session_store.rb
* config/environments/production.rb - if you want to run in production mode

h2. Getting Production Setup

Java is required to utilize YUI-compressor in the installed plugin yui_compressor_fu:

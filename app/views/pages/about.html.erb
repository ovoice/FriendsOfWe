<h2>About</h2>
<p><em>Friends of We</em> is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization. <em>Friends of We</em> challenges  Account Planners, Account Directors, UI Designers, Developers and Information Architects to contribute their passion and just a few hours of their time to Public Service Advertising campaigns in the interest making science accessible to the general public. </p>
<p>With the right leadership, organization and infrastructure, professional volunteers can contribute to make an impact that financial contributions alone could never buy. We aim to provide that organizational infrastructure. As our community grows and more resources become available, we hope to build a pool of shared knowledge resources to help public campaigns and organizations drive effective communications.

<h3>Background Story</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"While answering phones and soliciting donations for a presidential candidate in 2004, I was surprised by how eager some folks were to contribute.  I was sometimes greeted a web developer or an attorney eager to contribute more than the $200 we were asking for. They wanted to volunteer their services to a candidate they felt passionate about.  While I passed those names along, nothing ever came from it.</p>
  <p>"I kept thinking that there had to be a way to bring these passionate professionals together. After all, any UI designer willing to volunteer time otherwise billed at $250 an hour would contribute so much more value than they could with their dollars.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p><em>Friends of We</em> is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization. Our growing community of volunteers contribute their passions, talents and professional skills to develop local and global Public Service Advertising campaigns.</p>  
<p>With the right leadership, organization and infrastructure, professional volunteers can contribute to make an impact that financial contributions alone could never buy. We aim to provide that organizational infrastructure. As our community grows and more resources become available, we hope to build a pool of shared knowledge resources to help public campaigns and organizations drive effective communications.

<h3>Background Story</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Answering phones and soliciting donations for a candidate fund raising event in 2004, I was sometimes greeting by the occasional developer or attorney eager to contribute more than the $300 we were asking for. They wanted to volunteer for something they cared passionately for.  While I passed those names along, nothing ever came from it.  This was something I wanted to change.</p>
  <p>"I kept thinking that there had to be a way to bring together these passionate professionals. After all, Any attorney willing to volunteer time that might otherwise be biling at $300 an hour, can contribute so much more value than could with their dollars.</p>

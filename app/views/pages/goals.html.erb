<h2>Our Goals</h2>
<p><em>Friends of We</em> is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization that aims to  aggregate the passions, talents and professional skills of individuals who wish to contribute to their local and global communities.  While our initial focus is on Public Service Online Advertising campaigns, in the longer term, we hope to build a robuts community with shared knowledge resources and toolsets to more effectively aggregate their talents.</p>
<h3>Background Story</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In 2004, while answering phones and soliciting donations for a presidential candidate, I was sometimes greeting by supporters eager to contribute more than the $200 we were asking for.  It was the occasional developer or attorney who wanted to contribute their professional talents to help a campaign the cared passionately for.  While I passed those names along, nothing ever came from that.  This was something I wanted to change.</p>
  <p>"Sadly, my candidate lost the election, but I kept thinking that there had to be a way to bring together these professional volunteers. An attorney will to volunteer their time to a campaign or organization, who might otherwise be billing $300 an hour, can contribute a lot more with their time than they likely would with their dollars.</p>
  <p>"After gather my thoughts, I presented the idea to my boss and was told ‘You’re such a character,’ before she immediately changed the subject.  While discouraged them, the time now seems right to create the sort of volunteer organization I hope Friend Of We will become."</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Friends of We</em> challenges the Account Planners, Account Directors, UI Designers and Information Architects to contribute a few hours of their time as we build Public Service Advertising campaigns on behalf of and in collaboration with non-profits and in purist of more general public interest causes.  With the right leadership, organization and infrastructure, professional volunteers  can contribute their talents and passions to make a material contribution that their financial contributions alone could never buy.</p>
<p>We're still getting started, but if you would like to get involved, please volunteer or drop us a note.</p>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>Our immediate goals are to demonstrate a capability to deliver results while building the momentum and energy that will attract other professionals.  Building our first campaign success will help us establish a brand for Friends of We among public service directors at broader media outlets and give us some standing upon which we can build more successful campaigns.</p>
<p>In the longer term, we would hope to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide an infrastructure to effectively plan, create and promote PSA campaigns that leverage best practices from our member communities.</li>
    <li>Provide a framework, knowledge resources and possibly a toolset (web application) that would allow a more general audience to learn advertising/industry best practices and deploy those practices within their own organizations and communications, whether they be local, regional or national campaign.</li>
    <li>Branch out from a focus on communications to one that includes other disciplines.</li>
  </ul>
<p>It will require time, planning and dedication to build the infrastructure we need to achieve those goals, but with many small contributions of time from many volunteers, this will be possible. </p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
<p><em>Friends of We</em> challenges the Account Planners, Account Directors, UI Designers, Developers and Information Architects to contribute a few hours of their time to Public Service Advertising campaigns in pursuit of the general public interest.</p>
<p>As we are just getting started, our shorter term goals are to demonstrate a scalable volunteer model and the momentum and energy that will attract those volunteersprofessionals. Our first (pending) campaign successes will help us build relationships and build a establish a <em>Friends of We</em> brand among public service directors at broader media outlets upon which we can build more successful campaigns.</p>
<p>In the longer term, we would hope to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborate and build relationships with other non-profits we can help</li>
  <li>Provide an infrastructure to effectively plan, create and promote PSA campaigns driven by the best practices from our member communities.</li>
  <li>Provide a framework, knowledge resources and possibly a tool set (web application) that would allow a more general audience to learn advertising/industry best practices and deploy those practices within their own organizations and communications, whether they be local, regional or national campaign.</li>
  <li>Branch out from a focus on communications to one that includes other disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will require time, planning and dedication to build the infrastructure we need to achieve our goals, but with many small contributions of time from many volunteers, this will be possible. </p>
